We have the structures AtomSet and AtomMap to represent sets and maps
of Atoms. For any type t if we want sets and maps (dictionaries) we
need an ordering structure on the elements.  We would like to create
the set structure on RHS's. For this you first need to define a
structure of signature ORD_KEY for RHS.

*)

structure RHS_KEY : ORD_KEY = struct
    (* complete this *)
type ord_key = RHS
val compare = List.collate Atom.compare 
end


(*

Use the above structure to create a set of rhs's

*)

structure RHSSet = RedBlackSetFn (RHS_KEY)


type Productions = RHSSet.set

type Rules = Productions AtomMap.map


(* The rules of the grammar are a dictionary whose keys are the symbol
   and the values are the Productions associated with the grammar.
*)



type Grammar    = { symbols : Symbols, tokens : Tokens, rules : Rules }
