The repo name seems funny. Yeah, for tiger language I build till lexer and parser stages. <br>
That's why I kept repo name as Tiger + Lexer + Parser = TigLexParse <br>
Build Lexer and Parser stages for Compiler using Standard ML.<br>
### Project Setup
To Run the project download the repo into your computer. <br>
Ensure You have compiler for SML(Standard ML). <br>
Inside this go to project subdirectory using *cd project* <br>
Then to build the lexParse executable run the command *make tigc* <br>
and then run the lexparse using the command *./tigc filename* <br>
You can learn more about the tiger language [here](https://www.lrde.epita.fr/~tiger/tiger.html). The lexparse was built for part of the language.
